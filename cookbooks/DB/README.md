##### Challenges :

Overall, I felt quite lost at the beginning of this assignment. Some parts are very clear and some just aren't. After I did some research I kind of started to get the hang of it. Could use more practice, especially with the unit testing part of it. I get a little confused when writing the tests so I'd say that proved to be a challenge for this homework as well. 

-----

##### Take-Aways :

All in all I think today was very interesting. Homework helped me understand thing a little bit more but I could use a bit more practice. Not very happy with how things went with the homework, I hope I'll understand it a bit better soon.

I give it a 5/10.
